				Jason brought skill and passion to the MediaRadar development team. When we first brought Jason on he was put in a role that provided support to our 20 person development team. Within the first few months he outgrew that role and became a go to for other developers on best practices and technical knowledge of some of the newer tools available. Jason strives to not only develop applications that meet the specifications, but also, meet the high expectations of his fellow developers. It was a privilege to work with Jason and watch him grow as a Developer.

				Jason has the ability to take a project from inception to launch. I had the pleasure of working with Jason on a few projects and was impressed by his ability to understand clients&#39; needs and execute in a detail-oriented fashion. Jason would be a great asset to any team.
				<div class= "name"><br>- Adrian Fraiha</div>
			</blockquote><br>
			<blockquote>
				Jason started at MediaRadar as a junior developer and he got promoted as a mid-level developer the following year. Jason and I had been in the same team for over two years. Jason was able to quickly get an understanding of the existing code base he was working on to make effective updates to it. Jason also had quick bug fix turn-around because of his very pragmatic approach to problems. It&#39;s been great having Jason in my team!
